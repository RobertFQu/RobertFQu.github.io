I'm QU Shutong, a first year PhD student from [School of Science and Engineering](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/). My research interest includes gametheory, cryptography & decentralized systems. Now I'm currently focus on Airdrop mechanism design and games.

I'm advised by [Prof. CAI Wei](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/caiwei/) from [Human-Crypto Society Lab](https://hcslab.cuhk.edu.cn/).

I got my B.Eng. Degree in the Institute for Interdisplinary Information Science [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University in July 2019.
