I'm QU Shutong, a first year PhD student from [School of Science and Engineering](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/). My research interest includes gametheory, cryptography & decentralized systems. Now I'm currently focus on MEV & Data Availibility.

I'm advised by [Prof. CAI Wei](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/caiwei/) from [Human-Crypto Society Lab](https://hcslab.cuhk.edu.cn/).
