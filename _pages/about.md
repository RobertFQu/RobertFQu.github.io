I'm QU Shutong, an M.Phil. student from [School of Science and Engineering, CUHK(Shenzhen)](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/). My research interest includes gametheory, cryptography & decentralized systems. Now I'm currently focus on Airdrop mechanism design and games. I'm going to join [School of Engineering and Technology, University of Washington](https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/set/school-engineering-and-technology) as a Ph.D. student in Sept. 2025.
 
I'm advised by [Prof. CAI Wei](https://faculty.uw.edu/weicaics) from [Decentralized Computing Laboratory](https://sites.uw.edu/weicaics).

I got my B.Eng. Degree in the Institute for Interdisplinary Information Science [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University in July 2019.
